# docs

This is the source directory for sphinx documentation generation.

## Documentation generation

Ensure that you are in the current directory ([docs](.)) before running the
below commands.

First, install all required dependencies
```
$ pip install -r doc_requirements.txt
```

Next, build the html page containing the autogenerated documentation,
```
$ sudo make html
```

You can run `sudo make clean` to remove any previous build files

**NOTE**: Root access it required because sphinx `autodoc` extension imports
nest and nest requires root access.

`build/html` will contain the built html pages. Open `index.html` to view the documentation
